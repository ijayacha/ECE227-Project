# ECE227-Project
## What is the optimal Influence maximization algorithm to use for different domains of data and different network structures?
The dataset and the code used for this project can be found in this respostitory.
The python notebook contains the algorithms used to obtain the data in the project and some example simulations of how to run the algorithms. 
The notebook can be run from start to finish but may take a long time as the simulations require a lot of compute time.
